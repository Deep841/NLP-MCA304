    "## Data Leakage?\n",
    "#### Ans : \n",
    "1. data leakage happens when information from outside the training datset is used ti create the model. \n",
    "2. This leads to unrealistically good performance during trainig/validation, but the model fails badly on real-world unseen data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example in NLP: \n",
    "1. If we **fit CountVectorizer or TF-IDF on the full dataset (train + test)**,  \n",
    "then the model already *\"knows\"* some vocabulary from the test set.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. This is **data leakage** because the test words should be completely unknown at training time.  \n",

    "## fit_transform() vs transform() in CountVecotrizer\n",
    "#### fit_transform(): \n",
    "1. learns the vocabulary from the dataset and transforms text into a document-term matrix\n",
    "2. Example : vecotrizer.fit_transform(train_text)\n",
    "3. should only be used on training data, because it \"fits\" (learns vocabluary).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### transform():\n",
    "1. usees an already learned vocabukary to transform new/unseen text into the same feature space.\n",
    "2. example : vecotrizer.transform(test_text)\n",
    "3. should be used on validation/test data to avoid leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "#### from CountVectorizer prespective:\n",
    "1. if we do fit_transform() on the test set, we r letting the model \"peek\" into unseen data (test vocabulary) -> data leakage.\n"

    "## Summary\n",
    "Data leakage occurs when information from outside the training dataset is used during model building, leading to overly optimistic results. In CountVectorizer, using fit_transform() on both train and test introduces leakage since it learns vocabulary from test data. The correct method is to apply fit_transform() only on training data to learn vocabulary, and then use transform() on test data to ensure consistent feature mapping without leaking future information.\n",
